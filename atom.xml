    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned in my previous post that I would write a quick and dirty tutorial on how to obtain a blogging setup similar to my own. After following the steps in this post you should have your very own static Octopress blog that you can edit painlessly in the cloud via Nitrous.IO<!-- more --></p>

<h2>Register and Link Accounts</h2>

<p>First you will need to register for a free GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/">here</a>, and a free Nitrous.IO account <a href="https://www.nitrous.io/join/VGB0M15fkh8?utm_source=nitrous.io&amp;utm_medium=copypaste&amp;utm_campaign=referral">here</a>. Be sure to verify your email address with both services, or you will have trouble later on in this tutorial. Once you are signed into GitHub click the “New Repository” button and enter the following into the “Repository name” field:</p>

<pre><code>username.github.io
</code></pre>

<p>Where the “username” portion is your actual username. Leave the “public” radio button ticked and click create. Leave this tab open in your browser for easy access later!</p>

<p>Now jump over to Nitrous.IO and open your dashboard for the first time. You will have several options, but for this tutorial we will need the Ruby/Rails template. Select the template, fill in the name and region for your box, and click the “Create Box” button. On the next page select “Connect GitHub” and authorize the app in order to make your life easier.  If you so desire you can link up several of your other social accounts in order to beef up your free box, but you won’t need much juice to run Octopress.</p>

<p>Once you finish linking accounts click next and read the overview, or just jump to the bottom of the page and hit that big orange button. Finally, we’re in the Nitrous.IO IDE! Now we can get some real work done.</p>

<h2>Clone Octopress in your Nitrous.IO Box</h2>

<p>Click on the console window near the bottom and enter the following command:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/imathis/octopress.git
</code></pre>

<p>This should beam a fresh copy of Octopress directly into your Nitrous.IO box. Click the root (represented by “~”) in the file tree on the left a couple of times and you should see your newly created Octopress folder.</p>

<p><img src="http://timothysmith.me/images/screenshots/nitrous2.png/920/457" title="nitrous IDE" ></p>

<p>Click on the console window near the bottom again and enter the following commands.</p>

<pre><code>cd octopress
gem install bundler
bundle install
rake install
</code></pre>

<p>Congratulations, you now have Octopress and all it depends on.</p>

<h2>Deploy Your Blog to GitHub Pages</h2>

<p>We need to get this thing onto your GitHub pages account ASAP. First enter the following commands into the console to set your identity:</p>

<pre><code>git config --global user.email youremail
git config --global user.name yourname
</code></pre>

<p>Where “youremail” is your actual email address registered with GitHub and “yourname” is your actual GitHub username.</p>

<p>Now we can use the handy Octopress configuration task to automate the rest of the setup. Use the following command in the console to get started:</p>

<pre><code>rake setup_github_pages
</code></pre>

<p>You should be prompted for your repository URL. Remember that tab I told you to leave open way back when? Check it for your repository URL, and enter it into the prompt. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
</code></pre>

<p>You’re almost done! There are a few more commands you need to run before you have your very own Octopress blog.</p>

<pre><code>rake generate
rake deploy
</code></pre>

<p>When “rake deploy” asks for your credentials enter your GitHub user information. The password field will be a little tricky because it won’t show what you’re typing. Now backup all your hard work with the following git commands in your console:</p>

<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m ‘Initial deploy’
git push origin source
</code></pre>

<p>In a matter of minutes you should be able to point your browser to your GitHub pages URL and check out all your hard work.</p>

<h2>Additional Resources</h2>

<p>At this point you will need to learn the Octopress basics.  Posting new articles consists of running a command, editing the newly created file in markdown, and pushing it all back up to GitHub. You also may have noticed that your newly published website is rather generic. You can update all of your settings in the config.yml file as detailed <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/configuring/">here</a>, and if you desire something a little more swanky you can apply a multitude of free themes to your new Octopress installation.</p>

<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">octopress documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages">using a custom domain name on GitHub pages</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opthemes.com/">Theming</a> (my current theme is a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3">octostrap3</a>)</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a very fickle relationship with blogging. I love tweaking and testing them,
but when it comes time to write content I&rsquo;m already fawning over a new platform.
I am notorious among my circle of friends for building these things and then letting them
collect digital dust until they are inevitably scrapped. About a year ago I was surfing
around and happened upon <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. I was instantly enamored by the possibilities it offered.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Since everyone and even some of their mothers have already made a strong case for why static
site generators are the future of personal blogging, I&rsquo;m not going to dedicate this entire
article to that. However, I will say that Octopress seemingly suited all of my needs as a blogging
platform- no database to worry about, easy to backup, doesn&rsquo;t rely on a service that might
go belly up, simple theming, mostly free to host, and no one else owns the content I create!</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take me long to <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">clone the repository</a> and get everything running, but then I hit a wall.
I could only update the blog from my development machine. Octopress runs locally to generate
your blog via simple commands, and then it has to be pushed up to where ever you&rsquo;re serving your
website. I researched a few ways that might make it work in a shared folder, but the hoops that
required jumping through were numerous. To top it off I couldn&rsquo;t use my shiny new Chromebook or
any mobile devices for on the go editing.</p>

<p>I gave up hope on finding a solution until just a couple of days ago, when I stumbled across
<a href="https://www.nitrous.io/join/VGB0M15fkh8?utm_source=nitrous.io&amp;utm_medium=copypaste&amp;utm_campaign=referral">Nitrous.IO</a> as a coding platform for Chromebook. Initially I thought it was pretty nifty, but then
it dawned on me that I could use it to run Octopress in the cloud! I cloned Octopress into my free
box, linked up my Github account, pushed everything up to Github pages, and here we are. I still
have a lot to configure in order to make it my own, but I think I&rsquo;ve finally found a blogging
solution that I can stick with.</p>

<p>Once I get everything buttoned up I will write some tutorials for those of you who are interested
in getting a similar setup. If you can&rsquo;t wait, hop on over to <a href="https://www.nitrous.io/join/VGB0M15fkh8?utm_source=nitrous.io&amp;utm_medium=copypaste&amp;utm_campaign=referral">Nitrous.IO</a>
to claim a ruby development box and go in blind.</p>
