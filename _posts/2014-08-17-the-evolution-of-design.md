Fair warning, I do not have an eye for design. I actually struggle when trying to design anything visual, but from time to time my career requires a bit of design work. Recently I was tasked with creating a simple web banner for an online course. I'm not actually sure if it will ever get used, so I wanted to show it off and talk a little about the process.

####Title 1

I started with the simple idea of using a chalkboard effect and brushed up on my Photoshop skills with [this tutorial](http://sweetcsdesigns.com/make-a-chalkboard-effect-in-photoshop/). I came up with something in my head that I thought would be rad, but when it actually materialized I was more than a little underwhelmed. The effect was nice, but I needed to phone in some help on the layout.

####Title 2

Once again, like countless other times, my wife comes to the rescue. I sent her a picture of the design and asked how she felt about it. She danced around the truth for a few minutes trying to spare my feelings, and then she told me straight up, "It confuses me." I tried to defend my design and gave her a rough idea of what I was going for. She did conced that it looked like a chalk board, but we both agreed it needed some work. She chatted me some ideas: sweet banner at the top, cool underline for social media, cool designed sides, and a sweet arrow. Then she sent me a picture of this post-it note.
