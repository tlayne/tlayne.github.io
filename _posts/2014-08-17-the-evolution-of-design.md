Fair warning, I do not have an eye for design. I actually struggle when trying to design anything visual, but from time to time my career requires a bit of design work. Recently I was tasked with creating a simple web banner for an online course. I'm not actually sure if it will ever get used, so I wanted to show it off and talk a little about the process.

####A Rough Beginning

I started with the simple idea of using a chalkboard effect and brushed up on my Photoshop skills with [this tutorial](http://sweetcsdesigns.com/make-a-chalkboard-effect-in-photoshop/). I came up with something in my head that I thought would be rad, but when it actually materialized I was more than a little underwhelmed. The effect was nice, but I needed to phone in some help on the layout.

####Something Forms

Once again, like countless other times, my wife comes to the rescue. I sent her a picture of the design and asked how she felt about it. She danced around the truth for a few minutes trying to spare my feelings, and then she told me straight up, "It confuses me." I tried to defend my design and gave her a rough idea of what I was going for. She did concede that it looked like a chalk board, but we both agreed it needed some work. She chatted me some ideas: sweet banner at the top, cool underline for social media, cool designed sides, and a sweet arrow. Then she sent me a post-it note.

####All Grown Up

I went back to the drawing board with her design ideas and produced something that was light-years ahead of my original design. At this point she's still the mastermind, and I'm just the guy that put it all together. My goal for future projects will be to go through my own revision process before begging for assistance, but I won't discount collaboration because I think it breeds the best ideas. Everyone needs a little push from time to time, right?
